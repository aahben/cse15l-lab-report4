## Part 2
Which of these two styles would you prefer using if you had to work on a program that you were running remotely, and why?
I would prefer utilizing vim. It seems that vim would be the convinient and fast way when proficient with. When utilizing vim, I wouldn't have to use my mouse at all.

What about the project or task might factor into your decision one way or another? (If nothing would affect your decision, say so and why!)
